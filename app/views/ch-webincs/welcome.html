What I changed!
# Heading is now a H1 with classes of .form-title .heading-large
# Removed ALL old div content out, so the only divs on the page are the grid row and column ones from the GDS stuff (saying that, I also added GDS .form-control divs, see next note)
# Brand new styles can be seen in public/stylesheets/ch-webincs-gds-prototype.css
# De-capitalised content, eg BACK becomes Back
# Wrapped some elements in a div with a GDS class of .form-group - this gives the large bottom margin space
# Added a (new) secondary class of form-control-full-width to the password input, to make it wider
# Used GDS code (http://govuk-elements.herokuapp.com/form-elements/#form-toggle-content) to hide password field
